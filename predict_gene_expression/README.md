# Epigenetic gene expression prediction


Predicting gene expression using cpg-level methylation and hydroxymethylation data

`make_data` contains *incomplete* script to make input data, combining logTPM RNA-seq gene expression data and mC and hmC from TAPS sequencing

`models` hold a variety of DL models, and simpler baseline models.
